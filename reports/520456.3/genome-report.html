            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Brucella_melitensis.jpg/400px-Brucella_melitensis.jpg" class="pull-left main-img">
                <span class="pull-left"></span></p><p><i><b>Brucella</b></i> is a genus of Gram-negative bacteria, named after David Bruce (1855&#x2013;1931). They are small (0.5 to 0.7 by 0.6 to 1.5&#xA0;&#xB5;m), nonencapsulated, nonmotile, facultatively intracellular coccobacilli.</p>
<p><i>Brucella</i> is the cause of brucellosis, which is a zoonosis transmitted by ingesting contaminated food (such as unpasteurized milk products), direct contact with an infected animal, or inhalation of aerosols. Transmission from human to human, for example through sexual intercourse or from mother to child, is exceedingly rare, but possible. Minimum infectious exposure is between 10 and 100 organisms.</p>
<p>The different species of <i>Brucella</i> are genetically very similar, although each has a slightly different host specificity. Hence, the NCBI taxonomy includes most <i>Brucella</i> species under <i>B. melitensis</i>.</p>
<p>The many names of brucellosis include (human disease/animal disease):</p>
<ul><li>Malta fever/Bang&apos;s disease</li>
<li>Undulant fever/enzootic abortion</li>
<li>Mediterranean fever/epizootic abortion</li>
<li>Rock fever of Gibraltar/slinking of calves</li>
<li>Gastric fever/ram epididymitis</li>
<li>Contagious abortion/spontaneous abortion</li>
</ul><p></p>
            <p></p>

            <p>
                Brucella neotomae was first isolated in 1957 from wood rats (Neotoma lepida) in North America and  has been considered nonzoonotic. Brucella neotomae 5K33 (ATCC 23459) is the type strain and will be used for comparative analysis with other Brucella species.

            <h2>Genome Assembly</h2>
            <p>
                Brucella neotomae BNWLG2-S2 ran under job ID 2fee1c1b-f8bb-4781-bb20-f08fa66398e1 at PATRIC (1).  The assembly job started at 10/6/17, 2:53 PM and completed at 10/7/17, 4:41 PM, after 25h 47m 90011s.  The auto assembly strategy was selected, and it runs BayesHammer [2] on short reads, followed by three assembly strategies that include Velvet [3], IDBA [4] and Spades [5], each of which is given an assembly score by ARAST, an in-house script. The minimum contig length was 120bp, and smaller contigs were not included in the assembly. The minimum contig coverage was 5, and contigs with less coverage were not included in the assembly.
                Also add reference to QUAST. ARAST ranked the Spades assembly best (<table-ref>Table 1</table-ref>).
            </p>
            <p>
                The assembled genome has 11 contigs, with the total length of 3.31 Mbp and %GC of 57.3%.

            <h2>Genome Annotation</h2>
            <p>
                The Genome Annotation Service in PATRIC [1] uses the RAST tool kit (RASTtk) [6] to
                provide annotation of genomic features. The job for B. neotomae BNWLG2-S2
                ran under job number 685fb8c1-348a-4cea-a298-496b037af1f8.
                The annotation job started at 10/9/17, 7:10 AM and completed at 10/9/17, 8:16 AM,
                after 1h 5m 3623s.  The selected domain was Bacteria, the Taxonomy ID was 234.128.
                The Genetic code was 11.  The taxonomy of B. neotomae BNWLG2-S2 is:

            <h2>Genome Quality</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the analysis of genome assembly and annotation statistics and comparing
                them to other closely related genomes available in PATRIC for the same species, the
                overall genome seems to be of [high/medium/low] quality.
                The reasons affecting the quality of genome are: [genome qc flags].

            <h2>Subsystem Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                A subsystem is a set of protein functions that are related. Frequently, subsystems
                represent the collection of functional roles that make up a metabolic pathway, a complex
                (e.g., the ribosome), or a class of proteins (e.g., two-component signal-transduction
                proteins or AMR genes) [Overbeek].  An overview of the subsystems for this genome
                is provided in <fig-ref>Figure 2</fig-ref>.

            <h2>Phylogenetic Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                PATRIC [1] provides a phylogentic tree building service.  The makes use of
                several third-party tools. These include, BLAST[1], MCL[2], Muscle[3],
                hmmbuild[4], hmmsearch[4], Gblocks[5], FastTree[6], and RAxML[7].
                The pipeline begins with thegi set of ingroup genome protein files.
                These are filtered to remove duplicate species, resulting in a distinct-species
                subset of the ingroup genomes. This is done to reduce biasing the homolog
                sets with overrepresented species. BLAST searches are used to find
                bi-directional best hit protein pairs between genomes, and these bidirectional
                best hit pairs are clustered using MCL. Clusters containing members from at least
                half of the distinct genomes are chosen as initial, or seed, homolog sets. These
                seed sets are expanded to include members from all ingroup and outgroup taxa using
                tools from the HMMer suite. A hidden Markov Model (HMM) is built from each seed
                set using hmmbuild. These HMMs are used to search each genome, with hmmsearch,
                to find the best match from each genome for each homolog set model. The final,
                expanded, homolog sets are created from the hmmsearch results. Homolog sets representing
                fewer than 80% of ingroup genomes are removed. The remaining sets are aligned
                using Muscle, and the alignments are trimmed using GBlocks.
                The trimmed alignments are concatenated and this concatenated alignment is
                used to build the main tree with either RAxML or FastTree.
