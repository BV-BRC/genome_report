                Brucella neotomae BNWLG2-S2 was isolated from the urine of a 49 year-old female who presented to a clinic in Pennsylvania on April 26th 2016 with symptoms indicative of a UTI. It harbors mcr-1 and blaCTX-M on a Novel IncF Plasmid, First report of mcr-1 in the USA.

            <p>
                Brucella neotomae BNWLG2-S2 ran under job ID 2fee1c1b-f8bb-4781-bb20-f08fa66398e1 at PATRIC (1).  The assembly job started at 10/6/17, 2:53 PM and completed at 10/7/17, 4:41 PM, after 25h 47m 90011s.  The auto assembly strategy was selected, and it runs BayesHammer [2] on short reads, followed by three assembly strategies that include Velvet [3], IDBA [4] and Spades [5], each of which is given an assembly score by ARAST, an in-house script. The minimum contig length was 120bp, and smaller contigs were not included in the assembly. The minimum contig coverage was 5, and contigs with less coverage were not included in the assembly.
                Also add reference to QUAST. ARAST ranked the Spades assembly best (Table 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                The assembled genome has 33 contigs, with the total length of 3.31 Mbp and %GC of 57.26%.

            <h2>Genome Annotation</h2>
            <p>
                The Genome Annotation Service in PATRIC [1] uses the RAST tool kit (RASTtk) [6] to
                provide annotation of genomic features. The job for B. neotomae BNWLG2-S2
                ran under job number 685fb8c1-348a-4cea-a298-496b037af1f8.
                The annotation job started at 10/9/17, 7:10 AM and completed at 10/9/17, 8:16 AM,
                after 1h 5m 3623s.  The selected domain was Bacteria, the Taxonomy ID was 234.128.
                The Genetic code was 11.  The taxonomy of B. neotomae BNWLG2-S2 is:

            <p>
                The annotations includes 3349 CDS, 50 tRNAs and 3 rRNAs.
                All annotated genome features for this genome are summarized in Table 3.
            </p>

            <p>
                The functional annotation included 655 hypothetical proteins and 2694 proteins with functional assignments.
                Furthermore, 963 proteins were  assigned EC numbers and 749 proteins were mapped to KEGG pathways.
                A breakdown of the proteins that have been annotated for this isolate is provided in Table 4.

            <h2>Genome Quality</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the analysis of genome assembly and annotation statistics and comparing
                them to other closely related genomes available in PATRIC for the same species, the
                overall genome seems to be of [high/medium/low] quality.
                The reasons affecting the quality of genome are: [genome qc flags].

            <h2>Specialty Genes</h2>
            <p>
                PATRIC [1] annotation also includes identification of proteins that have homology to
                known virulence factors, drug targets, and antibiotic resistance genes (Reference
                the sources).  A breakdown of the distribution is provided (Table 5).

            <h2>Subsystem Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                A subsystem is a set of protein functions that are related. Frequently, subsystems
                represent the collection of functional roles that make up a metabolic pathway, a complex
                (e.g., the ribosome), or a class of proteins (e.g., two-component signal-transduction
                proteins or AMR genes) [Overbeek].  An overview of the subsystems for this genome
                is provided in Figure 2.

            <h2>Phylogenetic Analysis</h2>

            <p>
                PATRIC [1] provides a phylogentic tree building service.  The makes use of
                several third-party tools. These include, BLAST[1], MCL[2], Muscle[3],
                hmmbuild[4], hmmsearch[4], Gblocks[5], FastTree[6], and RAxML[7].
                The pipeline begins with thegi set of ingroup genome protein files.
                These are filtered to remove duplicate species, resulting in a distinct-species
                subset of the ingroup genomes. This is done to reduce biasing the homolog
                sets with overrepresented species. BLAST searches are used to find
                bi-directional best hit protein pairs between genomes, and these bidirectional
                best hit pairs are clustered using MCL. Clusters containing members from at least
                half of the distinct genomes are chosen as initial, or seed, homolog sets. These
                seed sets are expanded to include members from all ingroup and outgroup taxa using
                tools from the HMMer suite. A hidden Markov Model (HMM) is built from each seed
                set using hmmbuild. These HMMs are used to search each genome, with hmmsearch,
                to find the best match from each genome for each homolog set model. The final,
                expanded, homolog sets are created from the hmmsearch results. Homolog sets representing
                fewer than 80% of ingroup genomes are removed. The remaining sets are aligned
                using Muscle, and the alignments are trimmed using GBlocks.
                The trimmed alignments are concatenated and this concatenated alignment is
                used to build the main tree with either RAxML or FastTree.
